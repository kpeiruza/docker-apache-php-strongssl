# docker-apache-php-strongssl

A lot of work still needed, please stay tunned.

*Objectives:*
- A+ on SSLlabs (config ready, let's see how to put it nicely in a Dockerfile)
- Provide most common PHP modules, so you can run popular apps right away
- Remove absolutely every unnecessary bit in the container, despite being originally based on a Debian Image
